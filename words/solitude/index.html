      <h1>Solitude.</h1>

      <p>"No, I'm good."</p>
      <p>Then comes the inevitable lack of belief: "You sure?"</p>
      <p>"Yeah, I'm good."</p>
      <p>I have a tendency to be a quiet person. If you catch me in a moment of excitement over a topic I'm particularly passionate about, I'm sure I can talk your ear off. More often than not, though, I enjoy just observing. I like the quiet. I'm even happy to be alone. I'm the only person I know that willingly takes week-long vacations completely alone. Maybe there's something wrong with me.</p>
      <p>I feel like I can finally breathe a bit in the calm of solitude. That's mainly why I've started a tradition of spending a week alone in a wooded cabin every couple of months. No agenda. No rush. No people. No noise (other than nature). No technology (gasp!). It's just me and my thoughts and a few good books.</p>
      <p>Is that terrifying? It seems so, at least to most people I talk to. I sometimes wonder why that is. Maybe it's a product of our digital age. We're constantly wired, always connected, always rushing about. Quiet seems odd. Foreign. Abnormal. So we just continue to rush. We continue to fill our schedules. We don't want to seem unproductive, right?</p>
      <p>Maybe there is benefit to be had by retreating a bit every so often. Our culture is so loud, constantly trying to grab our attention. In a couple weeks I hope to be in a cabin, reading a book after having went for a hike. Maybe you should too. Just make sure you're in that cabin way over there. I want to be alone.</p>
