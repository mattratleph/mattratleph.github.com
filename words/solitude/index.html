      <h1>Solitude.</h1>

      <p>"No, I'm good."</p>
      <p>Then comes the inevitable lack of belief: "You sure?"</p>
      <p>"Yeah, I'm good."</p>
      <p>Have you ever felt alone in the midst of a crowd? Of course you have. Most likely everyone has, at some point. Why is that? How can we be surrounded by people, even close friends, and still feel hopelessly and utterly alone?</p>
      <p>No one gets us. I mean, they've known us for a while, but they don't <em>really</em> get us. How could they? Their lives are so incredibly different than ours. Early twenty-something. Grew up in a picture-perfect Christian home. Homeschooled. Married right out of college. Working on their second or third kid. That's their life? How could they possibly get you?</p>
      <p>Late twenty-something. Your dad died when you were in high school. Atheist for most of your adolescence. Rebelled out of anger and depression. Still single, with no potential prospects. How could anyone your age possibly get you? Your life is so incredibly different than theirs. At least until you start searching. Until you start asking questions.</p>
      <p>I sometimes wonder to what extend we lie to ourselves in the midst of loneliness. We shut people out because they wouldn't understand. We retreat inside ourselves as a rather odd attempt at escaping our pain. It would seem that we're social beings, meant for community. Are we routinely fleeing from the help offered by others in a sad show of pride?</p>
