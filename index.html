      <h1>Hi, I'm Matt Ratleph.</h1>
      <p>I'm a Christian, saved by the grace of God through Jesus Christ. I'm a minimalist, trying to live as lightly and calmly as possible. I'm a hacker and a creator, seeing art in <a href="https://github.com/mattratleph">code</a>, music, and words. I'm also one of the cofounders of <a href="http://umberlas.com">Umberlas</a>, helping artists to connect through service. I hope you enjoy what I've made at least as much as I enjoyed making it.</p>
      <h2>Music.</h2>
      <p>I make music of the electronic variety, frequenting the genres of ambient, downtempo, and trip hop. If those sounds are something that would entice you, be my guest to these EPs. I don't charge anything for my music, and I hold no claim of copyright. Do with these files what you will, but please at least enjoy them.</p>

      <h2>Words.</h2>
      <p>I'm something of a rambler. I have odd thoughts and I tend to take a while to explain them. From time to time, I may archive those musings here. I hold no claim of copyright over anything I write. Do with these posts what you will, and peruse at your leisure.</p>
