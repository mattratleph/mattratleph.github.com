      <h1>Hi, I'm Matt Ratleph.</h1>
      <p>I'm a Christian saved by the grace of God through Jesus. I'm a minimalist, so I try to live lightly and calmly. I like to create art in <a href="https://github.com/mattratleph">code</a>, music, and words. I'm also one of the cofounders of <a href="http://umberlas.com">Umberlas</a>.
      <h2>Music.</h2>
      <p>I make music of the electronic variety, frequenting the genres of ambient, downtempo, and trip hop. If those sounds are something that would entice you, be my guest to these EPs. I don't charge anything for my music, and I hold no claim of copyright. Do with these files what you will, but please at least enjoy them.</p>

      <h2>Words.</h2>
      <p>I'm something of a rambler. I have odd thoughts and I tend to take a while to explain them. From time to time, I may archive those musings here. I hold no claim of copyright over anything I write. Do with these posts what you will, and peruse at your leisure.</p>
