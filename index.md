# Hi, I'm Matt Ratleph. 

I'm a [Christian](http://blog.sgclife.org/2011/07/23/meet-matt-r/) saved by the grace of God through Jesus. 

I'm a [minimalist](http://mnmlist.com/less/), so I try to live lightly and calmly. 

I like to create art in [code](https://github.com/mattratleph), [music](music/), and [words](words/). 

So, hi there. How's it going?
