Sermon for Jericho Road Church on March 6th, 2016. Notes below:

First Kings chapters 10 and 11:

> And [the queen of Sheba] said to the king, "The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom, but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. And behold, the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report that I heard. Happy are your men! Happy are your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel! Because the LORD loved Israel forever, he has made you king, that you may execute justice and righteousness." (10:6-9)
>
> Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. And the whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind. Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year. (10:23-25)
>
> Now King Solomon loved many foreign women, along with the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women, from the nations concerning which the LORD had said to the people of Israel, "You shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods." Solomon clung to these in love. He had 700 wives, who were princesses, and 300 concubines. And his wives turned away his heart. (11:1-3)
>
> Therefore the LORD said to Solomon, "Since this has been your practice and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant. Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your days, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son. However, I will not tear away all the kingdom, but I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem that I have chosen." (11:11-13)

## Reset 1: Riches

Solomon: Blessed by God, he amassed wealth and security.  
Us: We look to our possessions for happiness and fulfillment.  
Reset: Prioritize God first. Christ is our everlasting treasure.

## Reset 2: Wisdom

Solomon: God blessed him with wisdom, and yet he still disobeyed.  
Us: We look to ourselves, self-sufficiently walking through life.  
Reset: Prioritize God first. Wisdom comes from him alone.

## Reset 3: Love

Solomon: His heart was divided, led astray by his many foreign wives.  
Us: We easily drift from our first love, pursuing other people or things.  
Reset: Prioritize God first. Our hearts need to be drawn back to him alone.

## Our hope in Jesus

Jesus is the better Solomon. Jesus is the better king. Jesus denied the riches this world had to offer and treasured his Father. Jesus looked to his Father for wisdom and guidance. Jesus loved his Father first before anything else.
