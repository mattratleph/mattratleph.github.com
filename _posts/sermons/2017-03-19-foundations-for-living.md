Sermon for Jericho Road Church on March 19th, 2017. Notes below:

_Note: This message was a part of a topical sermon series heavily influenced by a book by Richard Foster titled "Celebration of Discipline" on the topic of spiritual formation. My strong preference would be to preach expository messages straight through books of the Bible. In addition, I would not recommend either Richard Foster or the book "Celebration of Discipline" and the teaching within it. This was an attempt to create a faithful message out of a poor preaching direction and schedule._

Second Timothy chapter 3, verse 10 to 17:

> You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra-which persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work. (10-17)

## Breathed out by God

All Scripture is breathed out by God. These are our Lord's very own words. If that is true, then these words should have a weight of authority to them. We should pay attention. Is Scripture our authority, or is it merely one reference among many?

If these are God's very own words, we should be able to trust them. Do we? Do we believe that Scripture is inerrant and infallible? Would God speak in such a way as to contain errors? Would God speak in such a way as to be proven false?

Paul says that Scripture is profitable towards the end of making us complete, equipped for every good work. Who / what / where are we seeking out equipping in our lives? Do we view Scripture as the place where God speaks to us?

## Foundations for everyday life

I have a friend who is example to me in this. His name is Danny. For a season, he was one of my pastor's. I now work with him at Crossway. Danny is a faithful man, and someone I deeply respect and look up to. He models Christ to me.

When Danny speaks about Scripture, you can see the excitement in his eyes. His whole face lights up, he becomes animated, you can hear the sincerity in his voice. He can't wait to tell you about what God has been showing him lately.

It seems like Danny is more amazed by what God has to say to him in Scripture today than he was yesterday. He embodies a child-like wonder that we read about in Scripture. I see Danny's example and it spurs me on to want to be like that.

## Our hope in Jesus

Paul reminds us that Scripture is able to make us wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. This is where we encounter our Lord. This is where we learn of the good news of the gospel of our Savior. We find Jesus in the words that he's spoken to us.
