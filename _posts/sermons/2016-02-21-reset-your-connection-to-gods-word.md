Sermon for Jericho Road Church on February 21st, 2016. Notes below:

Second Kings chapters 22 to 23:

> In the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the secretary, to the house of the LORD, saying, "Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money that has been brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the threshold have collected from the people..." (22:3-4)
>
> And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD." And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it... Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read it before the king. When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes... (22:8, 10-11)
>
> Then the king sent, and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem were gathered to him. And the king went up to the house of the LORD, and with him all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the prophets, all the people, both small and great. And he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. And the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people joined in the covenant. (23:1-3)
>
> And the king commanded all the people, "Keep the Passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant..." (23:21)
>
> Moreover, Josiah put away the mediums and the necromancers and the household gods and the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might establish the words of the law that were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD. (23:24)

## Reset 1: Humility

Josiah: Undone. He tore his clothes. He took scripture seriously.  
Us: Pride - We're self-sufficient.  
Reset: Floored by who God is and what he's done.

## Reset 2: Remembrance

Josiah: Reinstated the Passover. He remembered God's mercy.  
Us: Apathy - Scripture isn't needed.  
Reset: Cherish scripture as a reminder of who God is.

## Reset 3: Devotion

Josiah: Destroyed idolatry. Committed to obeying God's word.  
Us: Idolatry - We worship other things.  
Reset: God reigns supreme in our hearts above all else.

## Our hope in Jesus

Jesus is the better Josiah. Jesus is the better king. Look to Jesus as our better example of humility in the face of God's word. Look to Jesus as our better Passover. Look to Jesus as our better example of zeal and devotion to God's word.
