Sermon for Jericho Road Church on April 3rd, 2016. Notes below:

John chapter 21, verses 4 to 8 and 15 to 22:

> Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them, "Children, do you have any fish?" They answered him, "No." He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some." So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work, and threw himself into the sea. The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off. (4-8)
>
> When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I love you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs." He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I love you." He said to him, "Tend my sheep." He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?" and he said to him, "Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you." Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep. Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go." (This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, "Follow me." (15-19)
>
> Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who also had leaned back against him during the supper and had said, "Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?" When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, "Lord, what about this man?" Jesus said to him, "If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!" (20-22)

## Reset 1: Passion

Peter: He had a lot of passion, but was it for who Jesus really was?  
Us: Who do we think Jesus is? A good man? Someone we prayed a prayer to?  
Reset: A right understanding of who Jesus is should evoke passion within us.

## Reset 2: Faithfulness

Peter: He seemed grieved by the need to reaffirm over and over.  
Us: Do we realize saying yes to Jesus needs to happen repeatedly?  
Reset: Jesus is calling us to a life of following him, over and over again.

## Reset 3: Contentment

Peter: He seemed jealous of John's seemingly easier calling.  
Us: Do we come to God with stipulations and requirements before we follow him?  
Reset: We will give an account for our own life and not the life of others.

## Our hope in Jesus

God gives us all we need in Christ by his Spirit to say yes to him over and over again. This is why Jesus died. This is why he went back to his Father and sent his Spirit. Relying upon him allows us to passionately, faithfully, contentedly say yes to him.
