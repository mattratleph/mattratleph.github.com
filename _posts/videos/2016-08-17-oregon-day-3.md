My wife and I vacationed in Oregon for a week, visiting several nature destinations. On day three we went white water rafting down a nearby river.

Shot on an iPhone 6s, 30 FPS. Music is "that's not me" off the album "[long time coming](https://mattratleph.bandcamp.com/album/long-time-coming)" by me.
