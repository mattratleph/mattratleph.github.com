My wife and I vacationed in Oregon for a week, visiting several nature destinations. On day four we visited Oneonta Gorge and Mount Hood.

Shot on an iPhone 6s, 30 FPS. Music is "the valley can be long" off the album "[the unforgiving journey](https://mattratleph.bandcamp.com/album/the-unforgiving-journey)" by me.
