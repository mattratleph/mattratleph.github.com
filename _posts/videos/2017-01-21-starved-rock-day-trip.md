My wife and I did an early year day trip to Starved Rock State Park. I learned firsthand how slippery the frozen falls can be.

Shot on an iPhone 7, 60 FPS. Music is "peace breeds contentment" off the album "[the unforgiving journey](https://mattratleph.bandcamp.com/album/the-unforgiving-journey)" by me.
