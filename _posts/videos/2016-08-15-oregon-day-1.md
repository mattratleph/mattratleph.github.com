My wife and I vacationed in Oregon for a week, visiting several nature destinations. Day one was largely a travel day, ending with watching the sunset.

Shot on an iPhone 6s, 30 FPS. Music is "there's always a hope" off the album "[a life lesson well received](https://mattratleph.bandcamp.com/album/a-life-lesson-well-received)" by me.
